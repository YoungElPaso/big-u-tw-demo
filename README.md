# Big U. Elventy with Tailwind CSS, Alpine JS, Fuse JS Demo Site

This is a demo site built with 11ty using Nunjuks for templating and Tailwind CSS for style, Alpine JS for some interaction and Fuse JS to simulate an autocomplete enabled search service.

Its a proof of concept mainly to illustrate the ease, power and performance attributes of the front end stack of Tailwind CSS + Alpine JS and I guess Eleventy because its easy to set up, template and output a good static site.

Created with CodeSandbox, and deployed on Vercel.
